    <p>Welcome to my BWM150 subdomain site for the course "Introduction to Web Page Development". I am enrolled in a course at Pennsylvania College of Technology. This page has been created so I can show the progression of my HTML5 and CSS skils throughout the semester.

    <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. 3 years ago, I began college at my second home, Williamsport. I am excited to be workingtowards my graphic design degree. In addition to classes, I am involved on campus as a student leader in several areas. I love Penn College, my area of study, and the community of Penn College.</p>
