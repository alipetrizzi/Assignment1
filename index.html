    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <img src="images/ali_writing.jpeg" alt="image of happy customers" title="image of happy customers">
    
    <p>If we’re talking labels, you could place quite a few on me: Graphic Designer, Blogger, Student Leader, Vice President, Tutor, and more. Though the titles showcase my commitment to community involvement, it’s my attitude, organization skills, and work ethic that I’d like to share with you.</p>
    <p>As a leader in several areas, the eyes and ears of my peers often fall on me. I focus on spreading positivity at every meeting, team project, and conversation I am a part of.</p>
    <p>In order to manage jobs and maintain a healthy schedule, my organization skills and design studies work in tandem to ensure I’m always prepared, ready, and on-time.</p>
    <p>I enjoy creating color-coordinated planners for myself, as well as my peers. Different people have different needs, and I take pride in evaluating which organization method or visual layout works best for each person.</p>
    <p>If you’d like to learn more about me—like how I have a completely opposite fraternal twin, my realization that I wasn’t meant to be a dental hygienist, or maybe how I couldn’t speak until I was 5 years old—send me a message and let’s talk over coffee (definitely coffee).</p>
    
    <h2>A Few of My Hobbies</h2>
<!-- and unorderd list is below   -->
    <ul>
        <li>Play with my nephew—he is my favorite!</li>
        <li>Search on Pinterest</li>
        <li>Create arts and crafts or DIY projects</li>
        <li>Eat icecream</li>
    </ul>
